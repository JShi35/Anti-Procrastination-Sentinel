# Anti-Procrastinator Robot Application

This is a desktop application built using C++ and the Qt framework. The application features a robot widget that helps users manage tasks by providing reminders. Users can input tasks, set their priorities, and specify reminder intervals. The robot will remind the user about upcoming tasks and keep track of task completion.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can add tasks with a priority level (1-10). Tasks are automatically sorted by priority.
- **Reminders**: The application provides notifications at user-defined intervals (ranging from 1 to 180 minutes) to remind users about their tasks.
- **Interactive Robot Widget**: The robot widget can be dragged around the screen, and it remains on top of other windows.
- **Custom Notifications**: The application notifies users when no tasks are entered initially and provides reminders for upcoming tasks.
